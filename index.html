    <h3>History fo Islamic Republic of Pakistan</h3>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>

    <p>
        <em>This article is about the history of formation of the modern Pakistan and as a country after 1947. For the
            history of historical Pakistan, see

        <a href="#">History of Pakistan</a>
    </p>
    <p>The <em>history of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan</em> began on <strong>14 August 1947</strong> when the
        country became an independent
        nation in the form of Dominion of Pakistan within the British Commonwealth as the result of Pakistan Movement
        and the partition of India. While the history of the Pakistani Nation according to the Pakistan government's
        official chronology started with the Islamic rule over Indian subcontinent by Muhammad bin Qasim[1] which
        reached at it's zenith during Mughal Era. In <strong>1947</strong> Pakistan consisted of <em>West Pakistan
            (today's Pakistan)</em> and
        East Pakistan (today's Bangladesh). The President of All-India Muslim League and later the Pakistan Muslim
        League, <a href="#">Muhammad Ali Jinnah</a> became Governor-General while the secretary general of the Muslim
        League, Liaquat
        Ali Khan became Prime Minister. The constitution of 1956 made Pakistan an Islamic democratic country.
        <br><br>
        Pakistan faced a <a href="#">Civil War</a> and Indian military intervention in 1971 resulting in the secession
        of East Pakistan
        as the <strong>new country of Bangladesh</strong>. The country has also unresolved territorial disputes with
        India, resulting in
        four conflicts. Pakistan was closely tied to the <strong>United States</strong> in Cold War. In the
        Afghan-Soviet War, it
        supported the Sunni Mujahideens and played a vital role in the defeat of Soviet Forces and forced them to
        withdraw from Afghanistan. The country continues to face challenging problems including terrorism, poverty,
        illiteracy, corruption and political instability. Terrorism due to War of Afghanistan damaged the country's
        economy and infrastructure to a great extent from 2001-09 but Pakistan is once again developing.
